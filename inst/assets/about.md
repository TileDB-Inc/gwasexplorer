### Background

This demonstration app allows you to explore results from the [Round 2][1] release of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results generated by the UKBiobank and the [Neale Lab][3].

Association tests were performed on 361,194 samples for over 4,000 traits. Summary statistics for these analyses are publicly available can be viewed [here][2].

As part of the UseR! 2021 TileDB tutorial, a subset of the GWAS results files were downloaded and ingested into a sparse TileDB array indexed by phenotype (i.e., the trait's descriptive name), variant chromosome, and chromosomal position.
### Usage

Enter the URI for a TileDB array containing the GWAS results and click the *Load Array* button.

Switch to the *Query* tab and choose a phenotype of interest and a genomic region to slice from the array. You can then:

- view the data as a table in the *Results* tab
- visualize the results as a manhattan plot in the *Plot* tab
- see statistics about the latest query in the *Stats* tab
