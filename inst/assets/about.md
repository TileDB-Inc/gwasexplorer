### Background

This demonstration app allows you to explore results from the [Round 2][1] release of GWAS results generated by the UKBiobank and the [Neale Lab][3].

### Usage

Enter the URI for a TileDB array containing the GWAS results and click the *Load Array* button.

Switch to the *Query* tab and choose a phenotype of interest and a genomic region to select from the array. You can view the data as a table in the *Results* tab or as a manhattan plot in the *Plot* tab.

Statisics about the latest query can viewed in the *Stats* tab.
